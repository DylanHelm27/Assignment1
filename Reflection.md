For my website, I immediately wanted to create won around my love of pro wrestling. Originally, I wanted to make it about each if the companies from the boom period of the 1990s. As the idea progressed and i started sketches, I decided for my planned pages it would be beneficial in terms of content to focus on modern companies and feature things like the champions or when the shows air. 

For the index page, I decided to make it a simple choice of three promotions and have the user pick one of those directly. When building the WWE portion of the site, I first went to the company's site, and picked the font they were using (roboto) to keep my site in unison with their brand. I then built the site page, with a big focus of images and proper formatting to help stand out from a simple html site. 

WIth the TNA and AEW portions, their websites did not have individual pages for each member of their roster, so I had to use third party site cagematch to keep consistent links for all three brands. I also chose to swap some portions of the layout to add variety to the site. For colours, I originally had WWE as red, but TNA also uses that colour, so i swapped WWE to blue so it stood apart, and it still fit as their show smackdown is blue themed.
